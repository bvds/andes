This file contains instructions for installing the Andes help server.  
The help server itself is a lisp program that stores log data in an 
sql database, and uses a c++ math library called "the solver."  
A front-end web server forwards student help messages
to the Andes help server and serves other static content.
See Documentation/server.html for more information.

This installation uses sbcl for lisp, Apache for the web server, mysql for
the database, and g++ for the solver.  It has been tested on Linux (RedHat 
Enterprise 5.4, CentOS 5.4) and OS X (10.4 and 10.6).

========================== System Configuration ===============================

# The following packages need to be installed:  
#      gnu make, git, subversion, gnu c++, mysql, mysql-server, and wget.
# For RedHat systems, http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL may be helpful.  
# In Linux, test packages using:
rpm -q make git subversion gcc-c++ mysql mysql-server wget

# The Andes help server should be run in an ordinary user account.  
# If needed,  set up a user account for the Andes server.  The install,
# unless otherwise directed, should be executed by that user. 

# For convenience, you can add the user to /etc/sudoers

============================ Get the Andes code ===============================

# If you wish to contribute code to the Andes project, do the following:
# Set up an account for yourself at github, providing your public ssh key;
# see "Generating SSH keys" at http://help.github.com/
# Send your git user name to help@andestutor.org so that you can be
# added as a collaborator to the Andes project.
# To install the Andes repository in directory "andes" use:
git clone git@github.com:bvds/andes.git andes

# Alternatively, if you would just like to use the Andes code:
git clone git://github.com/bvds/andes.git andes

# The rest of the install will take place in the Andes directory.
cd andes    # switch to the Andes root directory

# Switch to the stable branch of Andes;  the "master"
# branch is for development.  In the Andes root directory:
git checkout --track -b stable origin/stable

# For the system to work, a library of problem definitions 
# must be included.  The original Andes problem definitions
# are under copyright and not publicly available.  For access,
# send your ssh public key to help@andestutor.org
# (See "Generating SSH keys" at http://help.github.com/)
# The git command to download this library is:
git clone ssh://git@andestutor.org/home/git/Andes-problems.git/ problems

# Likewise, download the solutions repository:
git clone ssh://git@andestutor.org/home/git/Andes-solutions.git/ solutions

# Compile the solver library and executable:
make install-solver

================================== SBCL =======================================

# The sbcl website is http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/.
# A list of all releases can be found at:
#   http://sourceforge.net/projects/sbcl/files/
# In order to enable thread support and tune the garbage collection 
# algorithm, we compile a custom version of sbcl.  First, we download
# a binary release and then use that to compile the sbcl source code.

# The default sbcl install directory is /usr/local/;
# see https://bugs.launchpad.net/sbcl/+bug/550889.
# If you wish to install in a location other than /usr/local
# set the environment variable INSTALL_ROOT to this location,
# for example, "export INSTALL_ROOT=$HOME", before using the make
# command to compile the source code.

cd lisp-site-install
  make get-binary     # download a binary release
  make get-source     # download and compile source code
  make source-install # install in /usr/local (do as superuser) 
                      #      or in INSTALL_ROOT 
cd ../                # return to Andes root directory

make sbclrc  # Install the sbcl initialization file ~/.sbclrc

================================== MySql ======================================

# To save session data, we use MySql.  
# First, mysql server must be started.
# As superuser:
  /sbin/chkconfig mysqld on
  /sbin/service mysqld start
# Then set the root password (you can choose your own) and restart:
  /usr/bin/mysqladmin -u root password 'sin(0)=0'
  /sbin/service mysqld restart
# (In OS X, go to http://dev.mysql.com, install mysql and MySQLStartupItem,
# add /usr/local/mysql/bin to PATH in ~/.profile,
# execute "(cd /usr/local/lib;sudo ln -s ../mysql/lib/lib*.{a,dylib} .)"
# execute "sudo /Library/StartupItems/MySQLCOM/MySQLCOM start", and
# set the root mysql password using the above command.) 

# Set up tables in database:
make install-database

=========================== Apache Web Server =================================

# Configure Apache as a reverse proxy server, with json-rpc 
# error messages and add links to DocumentRoot.
# Run with superuser privileges:
make configure-httpd  

# Start up Apache.  In linux, as superuser:
  /sbin/chkconfig httpd on
  /sbin/service httpd start
# (OS X, do this from "System Preferences")

# If SELinux is running, I suggest you turn it off.  Otherwise, in RedHat:
sudo system-config-securitylevel # select Customize; select WWW (HTTP)
sudo chcon -R -t httpd_sys_content_t .  # httpd read permission for Andes files
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_relay=1  # port forwarding to help server

# To test the web server, point a web browser to 
#   http://<hostname>/web-UI/login.html

=============================== Javascript ===================================

# Make and build the javascript.  First we need to get 
# the Dojo library, then we need to make an Andes-specific
# build.  The master branch uses the development version
# while the stable branch uses (mostly) the latest release.
make install-dojo

========================== Test the Help Server ===============================

;; To test the Help Server type "sbcl" to start up lisp, then:
(rhelp)
(start-help :password "sin(0)=0") ;specify mysql password 

;; The help server is now running on port 8080.
;; You can test access to the help server by using telnet:
;;     telnet localhost 8080
;;     GET index.html
;; or try http://localhost:8080 in your web browser.  In either case,
;; help server should reply with the "Hunchentoot Default Page."
;;
;; Finally, you can test the entire system.  Point a web browser to 
;;     http://<hostname>/web-UI/login.html
;; Try to log in and solve a problem.  There will be an initial 
;; welcome message and intro window;  the screen will look like 
;; the one shown in the file Documentation/vec1ay-screenshot.png

(stop-help)    ;Stop the lisp server:

(quit) ;Exit lisp

;; See Documentation/server.html for further information
;; on running the help server.
