;; This file defines the equation set collection process for 
;; bubblegraphs.  The code in this section cycles through the 
;; graph collecting solution paths from the sought nodes to 
;; given nodes.  These sets are then used for traversal time 
;; help for the students.
;;----------------------------------------------------------
;; The search algorithm is as follows.
;; Define a set to be a tuple S K where:
;;   S is defined as a set of sought nodes.
;;   K is defined as a set of known nodes.
;;
;; Begin by generating a stack Q containing one set
;;  Where S = the set of problem soughts and K = nil.
;;
;; Generate a second empty stack of sets D
;;
;; Let F be a set of Forbidden Enodes.
;; 
;; While Q is not empty:
;;   Pop the top of Q into C.
;;   Let s be the top sought node in C->S
;;
;;     If s is a Qnode then:
;;        Let Es be the set of Enodes that 
;;        can be used to solve for s.
;;          For each e in Es
;;           Generate a new tuple C' where
;;              C'->S = C->S - s + e
;;              C'->K = C->K + s
;;           And push C' onto Q.
;;
;;     If s is an Enode then.
;;        If s is given then.
;;           Let C' be a new Set s.t.
;;             C'->S = C->S - e
;;             C'->K = C->K + e
;;           
;;           If C'->S is empty then
;;              Push C' onto D.
;;           Else 
;;              Push C' onto Q.
;;
;;       Else:
;;        Let Qs be the set of valid Qnodes 
;;        connected to s.
;;          Let C' be a new Set s.t.
;;            C'->S = C->S - s + Qs
;;            C'->k = C->K + s
;;          Push C' onto Q.
;;
;;---------------------------------------------------
;; An Enode E connected to a Qnode is considered valid iff:
;;  1. E is not a member of the forbidden set F.
;;  2. E is not already a membber of the current set S.
;;  3. E does not raise a nogood when coupled with the 
;;     other members of S.

;; Collect-solutions (public)
;; Given the sought qnodes from the graph and an optional list of forbidden
;; nodes iteratively search the graph for viable solution sets.  This function
;; sets up the initial sought nodes described above and itewrates until the 
;; que itself is empty.  
;;
;; At each time step the system will test to see if the que is empty.  If so
;; then it resturns the results set.  Else it pops the top element off of the
;; que and processes it generating any extension elements (if any) and adding 
;; them back onto the que for further processing or adding them to the Results
;; set iff the system is done.
;;
;; If the topmost element in the que is seeking a qnode then the solution will
;; be passed to Expand-for-Q for processing.  If the topmost sought in the 
;; solution is an enode then it will be passed to Expand-for-E.

;; Arguments: Soughts: A list of sought qnodes to begin the graph.

;; Returns: A set of traversal paths through the Graph containing Soughts.
