;;; This file defines the Andes2 Macro facilty.  Macros are similar to
;;; executables in that they can be embedded within Andes2 script as
;;; preconditions.  However, when a macro is encountered, it will be
;;; expanded into a possibly empty set of preconditions, which take its
;;; place in the precondition list.
;;;
;;; Macros do not appear as a unit in the solution graphs or in the 
;;; state histories but are replaced by their expanded forms.

;;; This code implements the macro (foreach <Var> <Form> <Literal>) It
;;; lisp-evaluates the given form, and expects to get a list back.  It
;;; then creates a list of goals that are copies of the given literal
;;; with the given variable replaced by members of the list.  For each
;;; of the remaining variables in the given literal, the variable is
;;; left in if it is bound and replaced by a new variable otherwise.
;;; Thus, unbound variables in the original literal act as dont-cares
;;; in the resulting list of goals that replace the foreach macro.
;;; Bound variables appear to be retained in all the resulting goals.
;;; Must use get-binding instead of Lookup because when a variable is
;;; bound to NIL, lookup returns NIL while Get-binding returns
;;; (<var>).

;;; This code implements the Map macro. The syntax is (map <input-var>
;;; <form> <prop> <output-var> <set-var>) The form is evaluated and
;;; should return a list.  For each member of the list, a goal is
;;; created by copying the proposition and replaceing <input-var> with
;;; the member of the list.  The bound variables in <prop> are
;;; left in and the unbound variables are replaced by new
;;; variables.  The output-var should occur in the goal and be
;;; unbound, so it is replaced by new variables with each iteration of
;;; the loop.  These variables are collected into a list, and a goal
;;; of the form (bind <set-var> (list . <vars>)) is appended to the
;;; end of the goals, where <vars> are the new version of the
;;; output-var.  This means that the solver will prove each of the
;;; goals then then bind set-var to a set consisting of the values
;;; "output" by the goal.
;;; Modified by Collin Lynch.
;;; I added the reverse to the renamed-output-vars list to ensure that
;;; the variables remain in the listing in the order in which they appear.
;;; This was causing output bugs in some of the equation files.
