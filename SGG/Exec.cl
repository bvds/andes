;; This file contains the executable code for the solution graph
;; generator.  This code allows for the inclusion of explicit tests
;; and bindings within the code.
;;
;; The format for all executable functions is that they are passed the executable
;; expression in full and the current state and may return a new state, a list
;; of states or nil.  For safety purposes the functions should modify copies of the 
;; current state not the state itself.
;;
;; Currently this file defines the following classes of executables:
;;  (Bind <var> <Value>)                       --> Bind the specified variable to the specified value in
;;                                                 the current state.
;;
;;  (test <Function>)                          --> Test to determine if the given function is true in the 
;;                                                 current state.  If it is return the state otherwize return nil.
;;
;;  (in-wm <Expression>)                       --> Test to determine if the given expression is in the 
;;                                                 state's wm and return true if it is.
;;
;;  (not <Expression>)                         --> Test to determine if the given expression is not in 
;;                                                 mem and return the state if it is nil otherwize.
;;  
;;  (any-member <var> <Function>)              --> Generate a set of states with var bound to the 
;;                                                 successive elements of the list returned by Function.
;;
;;  (debug <Form> <vars>)                      --> Pass the specified format string and vars to format.
;;
;;  (rdebug <Form> <vars>)                      --> Pass the specified format string and vars to format.
;;
;;  (count <exp> <form>)                       --> Count the number of wme's in the current state 
;;                                                 that unify with form and store the result in exp.
;;
;; Modifications:  
;;   10/16/2000 <Collin Lynch> Modified execute bind to fail if 
;;                             func returns nil.
