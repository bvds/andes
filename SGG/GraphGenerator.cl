;;;                  (accel Blk 1 :time 1)
;;;
;;;   Exp:   Lisp Expression representing this quantites' value.
;;;   Marks:  List of marks such as 'invalid_path' for help.
;;;
;;;   Equations: A list of equation nodes containing 
;;;	      this quantity.
;;;
;;;   (possible)
;;;   Tree:  A reversal and union of the paths for indexing 
;;;          by the help system.
;;;
;;;
;;;Equation Node  -- Represntation of inidividual equations.
;;;
;;;   ID:   Equation ID supplied by the solver.

;;;1. Initialize the list of Soughts with the sought elements in the
;;;   problem struct.
;;;
;;;2. Initialize the set of Knowns with each quantifiable given in
;;;   the problem struct.
;;;
;;;3. While soughts != {}
;;;
;;;   4. Pop the top element of soughts into S.
;;;
;;;   6. Call the turkey solver on S with the problem givens.
;;;
;;;      The solver will return a a set of tuples of the form: 
;;;	(<EqID> <Qs> <Path> <Assumpt>)
;;;	Where:  EqID an equation ID for the result equation.
;;;                Qs a set of quantities refrenced by equation.
;;;	        Path a list of path nodes that defines the 
;;;                     interface steps necessary to produce EqID.
;;;		Assumpt is the set of assumptions made in Path.
;;;
;;;   7. For each tuple T 
;;;
;;;      8. If no corresponding equation node already exists.
;;;
;;;         9. Then for each quatity Q in T (excluding the sought)
;;;
;;;            10. If a preexisting quantity node Q' for Q does
;;; 		not exists.
;;;
;;;	       14. Generate a quantity node Q' for Q.
;;;
;;;	       15. Add Q' to the list of Soughts.

;;; generate-bubblegraph
;;; Arguments:
;;;   Soughts : A list of kb-form sought quantities.
;;;   Givens  : A list of kb-form givens (quantitites and other params)
;;;  &key
;;;     IgnorePSMS : A list of psm-names (from ontology) never to be used.
;;;
;;; Returns:  A Bubblegraph comprising the solution(s).
;;;
;;;
;;; Bubblegraph generation follows a basic recursive model that is suprisingly 
;;; difficult to implement.  The search starts with a list of sought quantities
;;; each of these will be transformed into nodes and then searched for 
;;; recursively.  The recusrsive search will then identify the type of the 
;;; sought and take the appropriate action based upon it.
;;;
;;; If the sought quantity is already a member of the graph then that node will
;;; be marked as sought and the search will move on.  If the node is a 
;;; parameter then it will be marked as such and returned.  
;;; If it is a given then it will 
;;; be marked as such and its supporting given psm node will be added to the 
;;; graph and the resulting graph will be returned.
;;;
;;; Lastly and most likely if the node is a complex sought I.E. Requiring a 
;;; series of psms to solve then that recursive solution process will occur 
;;; and the resulting graph will be returned.
