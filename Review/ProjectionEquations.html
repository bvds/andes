   <title>ProjectionEquations</title>
</head>
<body>
Projection equations are equations that indicate the
relationship between the magnitude of a vector and its component along
an axis.&nbsp; For isntance, given the vector and coordinate system shown
below:
<br><img SRC="imageSHU.JPG" height=163 width=160>
<br>The projection equations are:
<ul>
<li>
V_x = V * cos(135 deg)</li>

<li>
V_y = V * sin(135 deg)</li>
</ul>
where V is the magnitude of the vector, and V_x and V_y are its x- and
y-components.&nbsp; The orientation angle of this vecrtor is 135 degrees
in a CCW direction with respect to the (right pointing) horizontal .
<p>Here are general projection equations that apply even when the axes
are rotated:
<ul>
<li>
V_x = V * cos (<font face="Symbol">q</font>V - <font face="Symbol">q</font>x)</li>

<li>
V_y = V * sin (<font face="Symbol">q</font>V - <font face="Symbol">q</font>x)</li>
</ul>
where <font face="Symbol">q</font>V is the angle of V counterclockwise
with respect to the horizontal, and <font face="Symbol">q</font>x is the
angle of rotation of the x-axis with respect to the horizontal.&nbsp; For
instance, suppose that V is&nbsp; 220 degrees from the horizontal and the
x-axis is 27 degrees from the horizontal:
<br><img SRC="imageJDN.JPG" height=163 width=264>
<br>The projection equations are
<ul>
<li>
V_x = V * cos(220 deg - 27 deg)</li>

<li>
V_y = V * sin(220 deg - 27 deg)</li>
</ul>
Although there are many simplifications of these equations that apply in
special situations (e.g., when the axes are not rotated), if you always
use these general versions then you will seldom make sign errors or trig
errors.&nbsp; On Andes, it is particularly easy to use these equations
because the orientation angles for vectors and rotation angles for coordinate
coordinate axes appear in the variable display and in the property dialog
boxes, which can be viewed by double clicking on the vector or axis.&nbsp;
The value of the orientation angle for vectors are known by Andes and never
need to be typed in as numbers.&nbsp;<b><i> TIP:</i></b> You can hold the
ALT key while typing a q to enter a Greek letter theta in an equation box,
so typing ALT-q followed by V is the keyboard method of entering the orientation
angle <font face="Symbol">q</font>V symbolically in an equation.
