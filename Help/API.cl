;;; The code in this file provides meta-information about the Andes2 API
;;; the parameters and functions are used to classify the API calls into
;;; categoried by name and to associate features to calls including the 
;;; type of return value and the location (if any) of the id.
;;;
;;; Copies of this file are located in two modules, Help and 
;;; LogProcessing/CmdReader/.  At runtime it will be used by the code in
;;; the CmdReader to generate the appropriate cmd structs from the logfiles
;;; and the code in interface.cl to generate the appropriate cmd structs.

;;; -------------------- old comment -----------------------------------
;;; The code in this file is used to process the api calls that come in 
;;; on the dde's and dde-posts.  My goal in loading the code into this
;;; file is to locate most if not all of the api-specific code into a 
;;; single file.  In reality, not all of the knowledge will be here but
;;; a sufficient portion hopefully.  
;;;
;;; This code is loaded by the cmd.cl file and the cmdreader file.  It is
;;; intended for use by those files but not necessarily for general use.  
;;; The predicates within this file are here for parsing and classifying
;;; the individual apis as are the predicates for extracting portions of
;;; them.  They can be accessed by anyone but it might not be a ideal to
;;; do so.  The cmd.cl file provides wrapper functions for accessing the
;;; relavent info as necessary.  
;;;
;;; NOTE:: The functions in this file should not be called directly, 
;;;        instead users should make use of the wrapper functions that
;;;        have been added to cmd.cl and cmdreader.cl  
;;;
;;; NOTE:: This code has been developed by reverse-engineering the APIs
;;;        If older apis varied a great deal it may be necessary to 
;;;        alter this into some version-dependent system.  In that case
;;;        the best bet would be to take the attitude carried out by the
;;;        states and compile the information at read time into the cmd
;;;        for now this is not an issue but it could become so later.

;;;; ==============================================================================
;;;; cmd-classes
;;;; in order to control some of the cmd behavior the commands are classified
;;;; into specific types for processing.  These classes define the result type
;;;; to be expected from the dde's and other values.  the functions and params
;;;; in this section define those classes and their relationship to the expected
;;;; result types.
;;;;
;;;; The parameters and functions here are used by the cmdreader code to set the
;;;; type and class values of the resulting cmds.  At runtime, the user should 
;;;; extract the values from the cmd struct directly.  

;;; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Command types.
;;; this parameter associates the command types to their respective classes 
;;; these classes are then used to deal with result types.  I have placed the 
;;; ontology here because it does not need to be in the kb section.
;;;
;;; The Unknown class will be given special treatment.  These are dde-types that 
;;; I do not have the time to deal with now or cannot determine what they are 
;;; For more info see below.
