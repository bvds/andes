;; ENTRY-API -- "adapter" functions to handle the Andes Workbench API calls
;;              for non-EQ student entries
;;
;; This module contains one entry-handler function for each Workbench entry
;; API call.  These handlers interpret the parameters sent in the API calls,
;; translating the calls into the representations needed by the help 
;; system. 
;;
;; For each API call foo, the API handler is called On-foo and takes the same
;; arguments.
;;
;; Each API handler function normally returns a Student Entry struct 
;; representing the entry.  As side-effects the handlers also update the 
;; symbol table with student label entries as appropriate and install the
;; entry on the entry list.
;;
;; An API handler may return T or NIL in case there is no good entry to be 
;; looked up; this value should be returned to the workbench.  This is 
;; currently only used for some angle labelling entries which need not 
;; correspond to solution graph actions.

;;
;; Following entry handling calls are ordered in roughly the order the student 
;; should follow: First choose body, then draw vectors and other diagram 
;; entries, maybe define some variables, draw axes, maybe draw components, 
;; then write equations, solve for desired variable and enter answer. 
;;

;; Note on entry ids and symbol table manipulations:
;;
;; The workbench allows the student to modify an existing entry by editing 
;; its properties in a dialog. In this case the workbench sends the same entry 
;; id for the revised submission as it did with the first. This edit can 
;; modify any property of the entry including the label.  The effect should 
;; be just the same as if the student had deleted the existing entry and 
;; then submitted a new one with the same id.
;;
;; To handle this possibility we have to be sure to delete any existing entry 
;; and undo all its effects on our state (on the symbol table entries, e.g.) 
;; before updating our state with the new entry. This is now handled 
;; automatically by the entry-list manager in the add-entry call. This call
;; will remove any existing entry with the given id, and this will call back 
;; to our cleanup routine "undo-entry" to do the work of undoing its 
;; effects, e.g. by calling symbols-delete-dependents to remove symbol
;; table entries dependent on the earlier entry contents.
