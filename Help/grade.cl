;;;               Grading for Andes problems
;;;
;;;  Currently (2011), old sessions are run through the help
;;;  system to set the system state.  Thus, we don't need to store
;;;  details of the grading state.
;;;
;;;  The general strategy is to attach bottom-out hints and red turns 
;;;  to steps in the solution.  If a student receives such a hint,
;;;  or a red turn, a label associated with that hint or a prop associated
;;;  with the student entry is attached to that solution step.  
;;;  This attachment persists even if the student object associated 
;;;  with that step is subsequently modified or deleted.  
;;;  However, a solution step is eligible for points only if there 
;;;  is a current green student entry associated with it.
;;;
;;;  Need to think about policy for optional steps.  
;;;  Consider two possibilities:  
;;;    A.  Include optional step in grading only if student 
;;;        sucessfully completes step.
;;;    B.  Never include step in grading.  
;;;  However, B seems to be at odds with an optional step being
;;;  preferred.  Maybe when we split optional into preferred and 
;;;  allowed, Bug #972, we would use policy A for preferred and B for allowed.
;;;
;;;  Error handlers often associate a student step with a correct
;;;  step.  Error handlers must also specify whether a given error
;;;  should have points taken off.  For instance, some errors are associated
;;;  more with Andes conventions/limitations and the student should 
;;;  not be penalized in those cases.  
;;;
;;;  If an incorrect student entry can be attached to a proposition,
;;;  and there is no associated solution step available, then we
;;;  need to specify a policy.  For instance, we could include a 
;;;  skill "correct quantities" where quantities not used in solution 
;;;  are attached.  Alternatively, maybe they don't count at all.
;;;
;;;  Eventually, weighting for steps should be determined by the 
;;;  median time it takes a student to complete that step.  This will
;;;  have to be done through a log file analysis, after the fact.
;;;  in the mean time, we need to make a best guess based on the amount
;;;  of typing and mouse movements needed to complete that step.

;;
;; Assume there are n possible responses and the student gets the correct 
;; response after j failures.  Let w_j be a multiplicative factor for
;; the score.  The student should get full credit if they get it 
;; right on the first attempt:  w_0=1.  They don't get any credit
;; were they to take n distinct attempts (this is impossible):  w_n=0.
;; 
;; For the case of the student randomly choosing answers, or getting
;; a bottom-out hint then we want them to get, an average grade of g
;; (+random-average-score+ in the lisp).  If the student is guessing,
;; the chance of getting the right answer after j failures is 1/n.
;; Thus we want:
;;               g = \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} w_j/n  (1)
;; In the extreme cases,
;;       g=1/n => w_0=1, w_i=0, i>0
;;       g=1 => w_j=1
;; For g outside this range [1/n,1], we simply use the end cases.
;; 
;; Consider the power law model, w_j = (1-j/n)^a, a \in (0,\infty).  
;; Eqn. (1) gives us:
;;              ng = n^{-a} \sum_{j=1}^n j^a
;;                 = \frac{n}{a+1} + 1/2 + O(n^{-a}) + O(1/n)
;; Thus, we have
;;              a = \frac{1}{g-\frac{1}{2n}} - 1 + O(n^{-a-1}) + O(n^{-2})
;; The power correction is larger when a is small or g -> 1.

;; The choice of g is arbitrary and would represent the value
;; for a student going through a worked example, step by step.
;; This might be something that we might want to vary by section.
