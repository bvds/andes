<h1>Stage 1 specification </h1>

<p>The goal of this stage is to demonstrate that the javascript
libraries are capable of producing a stable, cross-platform
user interface, having the minimal functionality needed for 
solving an example problem.


<ol>
<li> Due date:&nbsp;  Midnight, Arizona time, 
    <span class="date">March 13, 2009</span>.&nbsp;
      (I left this date intact for comic effect.)

<li> The drawing application should be tested on recent versions
of Firefox and Safari browsers.&nbsp;  It should be tested on versions
6, 7 and 8 (beta) of Internet Explorer.

<li> On all browsers, the testing should not raise any errors:
     IE enable "Display notification about every script error" 
     Firefox errors reported by firebug.
     Safari errors reported by "Develop" menu.

<li> Download of the application should take less than 13 seconds 
on a Cox Cable connection, where the measured download
bandwidth is 1.5 Mbits/s and measured upload bandwidth is 250 kbits/s.
[13 seconds is the median time for students, after opening
an Andes problem, to start doing something.&nbsp;  This number is based
from analysis of the USNA 2007-2008 log files.&nbsp;  Currently, I am 
measuring 35 seconds for the above benchmark using the 
<a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI">drawing demo</a>
on a fast machine, so I don't know if this target is realistic.]

<li> The drawing application should handle all of the user steps
shown in the <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/AAPT-2007/Nokes_Example.swf">Nokes demo solution</a> except for changes noted in the
<a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/nokes-example-json.txt">
    example json session log</a>.

<li> The back and window close buttons will end that instance of
     the user solving a given problem, or 
     <em id="ups">user/problem session</em>.  

<li> Determine reasonable behavior for the page reload button.&nbsp;  
     The issue here is:&nbsp; what happens when the client javascript 
     crashes?&nbsp;  I believe that users will generally  click on the 
     page reload button.&nbsp;  In that case, we might want to end
     the <a href="#ups">user/problem session</a> and start a new one.&nbsp;
     Alternatively, the reload button could have no effect on the user/problem
     session.

<li> Good behavior for losing Internet connection for a while:
       can still do problem solving steps, but messages to 
       server are queued until the server is back on.&nbsp;  Help system
       replies are handled properly even if there is a delay (red/green, 
       format for equations, hint messages, etc.).

<li> At any step in the problem-solving process, the user should be 
able to re-size the figure, re-size the window, and scroll the 
drawing area (if possible).&nbsp;  The drawing area "canvas" should have
the following behaviors:  
  <ol>
    <li> Rescaling should be consistent:&nbsp;  a given slider position
        should correspond to a given magnification.
    <li> Define a minimum canvas size determined as the smallest
        box containing all drawn objects and the initial drawing
        area, plus a margin.&nbsp; (Note that the minimum canvas may
        change during the drawing process.)&nbsp; 
        If the window is smaller than the minimum canvas, a single 
        scrollbar appears in each relevant dimension.&nbsp;
    <li> If the window is re-sized or rescaled to be larger 
        than the minimum canvas, 
        the canvas size is increased to fill the window.
  </ol>

<li> The drawing tool will have a toolbar and menu area as described 
in the supporting materials.&nbsp;  However, for Stage 1, we are looking for
minimum functionality:
  <ol>
    <li> The toolbar may be horizontal rather than on the left hand side.
    <li> The menu bar, menus, and score must be present but need not
         be functional.
    <li> The toolbar only needs to contain the axis tool, vector drawing 
         tool, a circle tool, equation tool, definition
         tool, rectangle tool, and help button.
  </ol>

<li> More details on the functionality of the drawing tools.
  <ol>
    <li> When vectors and axes are swept out, the angle is shown 
        on the screen.&nbsp;  See <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1489#c5">Bug #1489, comment #5</a>.
    <li> The dialog boxes associated with vector drawing (as well as
        other tools) will consist of one text input field.&nbsp;  A
        javascript routine supplied by the ASU team will determine if
        the input text defines a variable; see
        <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/variablename.js">
        variablename.js</a>.&nbsp;  If no variable definition is found, the
        input text will be attached to the vector, as in the 
        <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI">drawing demo</a>.&nbsp;  
	If a variable definition is found, the variable name
        will be attached to the vector, while the full input text will
        be attached to the cursor and the student can place it
        anywhere on the drawing area with a subsequent mouse click;
        the vector and the input text can be moved independently.
    <li> The text and equation tools can be either be used with a 
        single click or by dragging out a box.&nbsp;  In the case of a 
        single click, the width of the subsequent text box will be 
        determined by the contents.&nbsp;  If a box is dragged out, the
	width of the subsequent text box will be determined from that.
        Text will be wrapped according to the box width.
    <li> After an object is drawn, a description is sent to the help 
        system.&nbsp;  The drawn object will later be updated by information
	from the help system.&nbsp;  The color will be updated to red/green.
    <li>Graphics objects can has the status "locked," meaning that the 
        user cannot modify them.&nbsp;  The will be colored black.&nbsp; 
    <li> As in the <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI">
        drawing demo</a>, double-clicking on an object will allow
        modification of the text.&nbsp;  Single clicking will select an object,
        the delete key will remove selected object, et cetera.
    <li> On download, the drawing tool should show the problem statement,
        associated graphics, and pre-defined quantities almost immediately.
	The toolbars, menus, and associated functionality may appear later.
    <li> When selecting an object, a region around the object should be
        selectable, instead of just the object itself.&nbsp;  In the drawing
        demo, one must hit the object itself, which can be difficult if a line 
         is thin.
    <li> Using rectangle to mark selected object doesn't make sense.&nbsp;  
         Should have some alternative like fading the object or having some 
         bounding shape that matches the selection region.
  </ol>
   
<li> Help dialog window.
  <ol>
    <li> The help dialog window will be opened or brought into focus 
        if the help button on the drawing application is pressed.
    <li> It is supposed to look and function like a standard chat program.
    <li> Unlike Andes2, it is not modal with respect to the drawing application.
    <li> To ask for help, the student types "help" in the help dialog window
         or presses the help button on the main drawing window.
    <li> The help system will send plain text, which may include clickable 
        links.&nbsp;  It will also send messages that require a
        multiple-choice response.&nbsp;  The help dialog window needs to
        provide a mechanism for the student to enter a reply (either
        via radio buttons or clicking a link).&nbsp;  
	[In Andes2 most of the student replies are multiple-choice].
        As mentioned above, choosing the sought quantity will be done via text 
	entry.
  </ol>

<li> Window for selecting a principle of physics will be provided by the
     ASU team.&nbsp;  See the <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/sets">
     Andes problem chooser tool</a> for 
     a similar application.&nbsp;  SitePen will supply a method for writing 
     Greek letters in the menu.

<li> In order for the the drawing application to function, it must be 
     connected to a server.&nbsp;  See a <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/server-spec.html">description of the Andes3 Problem server</a>.
For Stage 1, the Problem server will not have any logging functionality.

<li> The communication protocol between the Andes3 Problem server and 
    the drawing application:
  <ol>
     <li> The API will use json-rpc defined according to the 
          <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/andes3.smd">
           Andes3 Sevice Method Description (SMD)</a>.
     <li> WebAssign login information and authentication
           will be handled by existing mechanisms (eg.cookies) provided
           by WebAssign.
     <li> There will be a unique integer marking each 
           <a href="#ups">user/problem session</a>.&nbsp;
           This id will be communicated to the server via a 
           <code>Client-id </code>
           http header or some equivalent mechanism.
     <li> Communicaton for the <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/AAPT-2007/Nokes_Example.swf">Nokes demo solution</a> solution is described in the
    <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/nokes-example-json.txt">
    example json session log</a>.
     <li> For Stage 1, visual presentation (colors, line widths, arrow shapes, 
	 etc.) will be hard-coded into the drawing application.&nbsp;  
         Eventually, such style information should be transferable back 
	 and forth to the server.
  </ol>

<li> The Andes3 Problem server will be running a lisp application called 
     the "help system" that analyzes student entries and provides hints 
     on demand.&nbsp;  
     The help system will use the same API that is used for client-server 
     communication.

<li> The team at ASU will be responsible for testing of the drawing interface.
     Usability testing will be carried out using paid student volunteers.
     Since we won't have the partial scaffolding mechanism (as described in 
     the <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/narrative-22.pdf">IES grant 
     proposal</a>), the students will follow a set of written 
     instructions.

<li> Through the development process, the code for both the help system and
     the drawing utility will be kept in publicly accessible repositories.
     Bug reporting will be handled through the normal Dojo project mechanisms.
     Also, any errors in the documentation will be reported through the normal
     Dojo project mechanisms and must be addressed by the project completion
     date.&nbsp;  All code developed for this project will have the associated 
     documentation and comments written simultaneously.

<li> The level and quality of the documentation and comments in any new 
    code will match the documentation associated with the present Dojo 
    core libraries.

<li> The team at ASU will provide server hardware and give members 
     of the SitePen team login access to the server, as needed.&nbsp;  
     Any code not placed in the Dojo project will made publicly available under 
     an open source license at the
     <a href="http://github.com/bvds/andes">github Andes repository</a>, 
     in keeping with the existing 
     agreement between the ASU team and WebAssign.

</ol>

<h1>Stage 2</h1>

<p>These are items that need to be completed in order for Andes to be used for
a classroom course.&nbsp;  The target date for deployment is August 2009,
so these targets will need to to be completed by mid-June 2009.&nbsp; 

<ol>

<li> Implement the input method described in 
      <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1488#c0">
      Bug #1488</a>.

<li> Implement the following menu items described in 
     <a href="http://www.andestutor.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1489">
     Bug #1489</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>File: 
          <ul>
           <li> close:  Close a problem and possibly navigate back to the list of problems, may have the
             	     same behavior as the "back button."
	  <li>  print:  Standard print button.
      </ul>
      <li>Physics:  All items in this menu point to external html files which then open
      		    in a separate window or tab.&nbsp;  Students generally like to have these available when
		    solving a problem.&nbsp;  The html pages are all printable.
         <ul>
	   <li> list of scalar quantities with example text for definition
    	   <li> list of physics principles.
    	   <li> list of pre-defined constants
    	   <li> list of notational conventions.
    	   <li> list of mini-lessons on various topics.
         </ul>
      </ul>
      The html pages will be supplied by the ASU team.

<li> Specify and implement user interface actions for drawing 3-D
    vectors.

<li> Draw lines, as needed for current optics problems.

<li> Specify and implement methods for inputting and displaying Greek
      letters, as well as help for students trying to input Greek
      letters.&nbsp;  Generally students do not know the Greek alphabet,
      but the help should gradually teach it to them.&nbsp;  A possible
      display method is for the help system to send a "displayed-text"
      tag to the client where the Greek letter is represented as a Unicode
      character or html escape code.&nbsp;  When the student double clicks
      on a text object, the input box displays the original typed text.&nbsp;
      
<li> After receiving a response from the server, the client sends
     a notification message giving time the response was 
     implemented in the client.&nbsp;  In json-rpc format, this would be
<pre>
{"method": "update", "params": {"id": 1, "response-time": 8.000}}
</pre>

<li> Implement the fading method described in the <a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/narrative-22.pdf">IES grant proposal</a>.&nbsp;  Create content for all tutorial problems, to replace the videos in Andes2 [ASU team].

<li> Logging all client-server API messages; see the 
<a href="http://gideon.eas.asu.edu/web-UI/server-spec.html">
description of the Andes3 Problem server</a>.&nbsp;  This will also allow
students to get previous work done if they re-open a problem.&nbsp;
The ASU team and WebAssign will be responsible for this step.

<li> Scaling to many simultaneous users.

<li> Integration into WebAssign.


</ol>

<h1>Beyond step 2.</h1>

<p>These are things we want to do, but are not needed for a minimally working 
course starting Fall 2009.

<ol>

<li> Specify and implement input formatting for equations.&nbsp;  I consider this
    to be an unsolved problem.&nbsp;  Most of the homework forums
         <ul>
            <li> <a href="physicsforums.com">physicsforums.com</a>
	    <li> <a href="freemathhelp.com">freemathhelp.com</a>
	    <li> <a href="mathhelpforum.com">mathhelpforum.com</a>
	    <li> <a href="mathgoodies.com">mathgoodies.com</a>
	    <li> <a href="sosmathhelp.com">sosmathhelp.com</a>
         </ul>
    use LaTeX-style equation formatting, which produces pretty results,
    is pleasant for experts to use, but is hard for students to start using.
    Cramster.com has a Microsoft equation editor-like tool which is easy
    for students, but would be annoying for experts, and the results
    are relatively ugly.&nbsp;  In addition, we are interested in parsing
    the equations for semantic meaning, rather than just displaying an 
    equation, which would suggest some format closer to Mathematica/Maple/
    Mathcad would be more appropriate.&nbsp;  Also, the "Microsoft excel-like"
    input formatting we have used for Andes2 has, in fact, worked fairly well.

    <p>In any case, there must be some sort of "equation palette" for 
    beginners with some smooth transition path to a text entry
    method that uses ordinary keyboard characters, for expert users.

<li>When equations or text is sent to the server, the server can 
    replace the text shown on the client with a mixture of text 
    and bitmap graphics images.&nbsp;  This will allow nice math 
    formatting of equations.&nbsp; See the the equation formatting
        on <a href="http://www.physicsforums.com">
        http://www.physicsforums.com</a> for examples.&nbsp;
    Double clicking on the object will reveal the original plain 
    graphics. 

<li>When an object is deleted or modified, then one should check its effects
    on other objects.&nbsp;  We didn't do this check in Andes2, but we
    should.

<li> Style sheets for visual formatting of drawn objects.&nbsp;  Visual formatting
    would include colors, line widths, arrow shapes, etc.&nbsp;  There should
    be a menu/dialog box for adjusting these on the drawing application.&nbsp;  
    The style sheets should be upload-able and download-able from the server.

<li> Make a version that can be used as a collaborative problem solving 
    tool for use on online homework forums like the ones mentioned
    above.

<li> "Bring to front" and "send to back" menu item, which works like
    powerpoint.&nbsp;  This may be useful if one had a very complicated
    diagram, and had difficulty selecting a particular object.&nbsp;

<li> Working undo button.&nbsp;  Perhaps just a one-step undo button, available
only after a modify or a delete, would be a good idea.&nbsp;  For the 
more general case, generating the associated help would be difficult.&nbsp;  

<li> Logging of UI events at level of keystrokes/mouseclicks.&nbsp;  Kurt and I disagree about
this one [Kurt says it is not useful].

<li> Representation for objects on system clipboard for sharing between applications.

<li> Regular editing features, cut, copy, paste, with associated keyboard shortcuts.&nbsp;  
     Andes2 has this functionality, but it is currently only useful for equations.&nbsp; 
     In Andes2, if any drawn object is cut and pasted, the result turns red since it is a duplicate
     of the original object.&nbsp; 
</ol>
