;;;;; This file defines the Equation set collection code for Solutiongraphs
;;;;; its function is to collect up the set of distinct equation and
;;;;; quantity sets that can be used to solve for a sought quantity in a
;;;;; Solutiongraph.  These sets are returned for use.
;;;;;
;;;
;;;The algorithm proceeds in two stages.  
;;;
;;;Stage1 is a black solution which is defined as a solution that contains
;;;a red solution and an unsolved-for quantity.
;;;
;;;A Red solution consists of a set of quantities and the equations that 
;;;solve for them.  A graph is complete when you have a red solution with
;;;no hanging quantities.
;;;
;;;
;;;To build a red/black traversal of a given solutiongraph do the following.
;;;
;;;1. Slect a quantity.
;;;2.   If the quantity is known move on.
;;;3.   Otherwise select an equation containing that quantity and solve it.
;;;4.   
;;;
;;;1. Place the sought quantitie(s) into a black solution.
;;;2. Select a quantity from the pool.
;;;3. Select an equation attatched to the quantity.
;;;4. If the equation is already in the solution.
;;;5.    Then the quantity is known, repeat.
;;;6. If the equation is not in the solution 
;;;7.    Then add each of its quantities to the pool and repeat.
;;;8. When the pool is empty the solution is complete.
;;;
;;;
;;;
;;;Solutions are stored for help time use as a list of 
;;;the form (<IDS> <EqnSet> <Assumptions>) this set is 
;;;then used to setup the solutions for later use. 
;;;These ids are a list of bgnode gindicies.
;;;the eqnset is a list of eqn indicies.
;;;The Assumptions are a list of assumptions.
