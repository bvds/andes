# Sencha Space Introduction

Sencha Space is a new product from Sencha that lets your organization securely run HTML web 
applications on Android, iOS, or BlackBerry devices. Sencha Space enables organizations to 
determine which users or groups can access the HTML web applications and limits access to
other applications from within the client application.

Sencha Space is unique in that there's no installation - the administration tool runs 
from Sencha and manages secure organizational access, and the client application
can be downloaded from Google Play, Apple App Store, or BlackBerry App World.
