;; This file contains the CMD struct along with specific predicates
;; to test and set various portions of the struct.  This file appears
;; in both the LogProcessing/CmdReader/ and HelpStructs modules.  The 
;; CmdReader translates each lofgile into a sequence of cmds using the 
;; code in this file.  The help system will translate the students 
;; actions as they occur into a sequence of cmds for use in runtime 
;; processing.  
;;
;; Each CMD represents a single workbench or help system action as
;; recorded in the logfile.  The actions are typically DDE's DDE Posts
;; or DDE-Commands.  The functions in the file are currently geared 
;; towards these three types although they can be used to track other 
;; command types as necessary.  
;;
;; The cmdresult structs are used to represent the results of the students
;; actions such as color-red, color-green etc.  These results can be used
;; as necessary to keep track of the students behavior and the systems 
;; responses.

;;;; ===================================================================
;;;; CMD Struct
;;;; when they exists and the current result.  In theory the results 
;;;; should be identical.

(defstruct CMD
  Class    ;; One of Help-Request, State, Post, etc
  Type     ;; Either DDE, DDE-POST,
  Time     ;; The Time that it occured (Htime)
  command
  text     ;; used only for delete-equation-cmdp
  Result   ;; The result either Nil DDE-Res or DDE-Failed
  )


;;;; --------------------------------------------
;;;; CMD class


;;; non-eq entries such as assert object are dde's that post a 
;;; value to the system.  As such they get a status return val
(defun noneq-entry-cmdp (Cmd)
  "Is this command a non-equation entry?"
  (equalp (cmd-Class CMD) 'noneq-entry))

;;; lookup-eqn string is our only eqn entry function.  If Async-mode
;;; is 0 then this will be posted as a dde and get a status-return-val
;;; if it is 1 then this will be posted as a dde and we will get a 
;;; EQ-Result as an asynchronous call sometime later.  This distinction
;;; will be handled by the cmdreader.  
;;;
;;; If async is set to 1 and a lookup-eqn-string appears as a dde then
;;; the system will throw an error.
(defun eq-entry-cmdp (Cmd)
  "Is this cmd a equation entry?"
  (equalp (cmd-Class CMD) 'eq-entry))

;;; Deletions remove an entry either equations or nonequations from the 
;;; screen.  Deletions are distributed as dde-posts and get no return
;;; value.  If noe is found as a dde then an error will be thrown.
;;; !!! [Bug 1254]] (lookup-eqn-string "") is a deletion when it comes via a 
;;; DDE-POST (and effectively a deletion if it comes otherwise as well). 
;;; But it doesn't get the 'Delete class tag set in its Class field 
;;; (see make-cmd call which uses lookup-command->class).  So this won't 
;;; detect those deletions. See delete-equation-cmdp below.
(defun Delete-cmdp (Cmd)
  "Is this cmd a deletion?"
  (equalp (cmd-Class CMD) 'Delete))

;;; help calls are expected to bring back hint responses to they get a
;;; Hint-return-val.
(defun Help-cmdp (Cmd)
  "Is this cmd a help call?"
  (equalp (cmd-Class CMD) 'Help))


;;;; --------------------------------------------
;;;; Composite types
;;;; These predicates detect supersets of the specific classes that 
;;;; are used for some of the predicate tests.  

;;; Return t if the cmd is an entry command
;;; either noneq-entry or eq-entry
(defun entry-cmdp (cmd)
  "Is this an entry command (either eq or noneq)?"
  (or (eq-entry-cmdp Cmd)
      (noneq-entry-cmdp Cmd)))


;;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; APIS
;;;; All of the cmds call APIs of some kind.  Typically we will want to 
;;;; access and compare those calls as necessary in order to determine
;;;; whether two cmds address the same object and so on.  The code in 
;;;; this section is used to identify individual commands and to extract
;;;; information from them such as the arguments to the api call, the
;;;; call itself and the ID.  This code can be addressed directly or 
;;;; called by the other comparison commands in this section as it is
;;;; below.
;;;;
;;;; Note:: The CMD does not store information such as the ID in it in
;;;;        the same way that the Type or Class information is stored.
;;;;        When the user elects to extract the api-id or arguments this
;;;;        information must be looked up from the list in a method that
;;;;        is version-dependent.  It might be better to amend this so 
;;;;        that the api-calls are stored in some other way and that the
;;;;        relavent infornmation is compiled into the cmd for faster 
;;;;        access.  For now the interface will be left as-is.

;;; --------------------------------------------
;;; Call tests.
;;; These functions are used to id specific api-calls
;;; that we want to track and make use of.

  
;; Note: delete-cmdp does not work for equation deletions
;; sent as DDE-POST of (lookup-eqn-string "" id) [Bug 1254]
(defun delete-equation-cmdp (CMD)
  "Test whether this is a delete-equation or lookup-eqn-string \"\""
  (and (eql (cmd-type CMD) 'DDE-POST)
       (eql (cmd-command CMD) 'LOOKUP-EQN-STRING)
       (eql (cmd-text CMD) "")))

;;;; ========================================================================
;;;; Result Struct
;;;; The result struct is an internal storage device for the DDE-Results and
;;;; the dde-faileds.  
;;;;
;;;; If this is a dde-result then the value slot will contain one of the 
;;;; dde-result classes and their value(s).  

(defstruct CMDResult
  Class    ;; one of dde-failed or dde-result.
  Value    ;; The value of the result:
           ;; status-return-val or dde-result or nil
  
  Assoc    ;; An assoc if one is present
  Score    ;; A set-score if one is present.  This is new in 2004.
  )

;;; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; dde-result structs.
;;; There are three types of dde results.  The root dde-result struct below
;;; contains only three fields the Command Value and Menu fields which will be
;;; filled if the system contains a command or hintspec (which will be treated
;;; as a show-hint command).  
;;;
;;; In practice each result will be one of the 3 specific result-type structs
;;; that I have listed below the base struct.  These add specificc fields onto 
;;; the base struct value and are used to allow specificity at runtime without
;;; pushing special-case code out into the handlers.

(defstruct dde-result
  Command ;; The dde-result command.
  Value   ;; The value of the command.
  Menu    ;; An optional menu field that goes with the command.

  )

;;; status-return-val
;;; status-return-vals are returned when calls are made to generate entries
;;; such as equations, vectors and so on.  The fields below contain the 
;;; contents of the return value.  
(defstruct (status-return-val (:include dde-result))
  Coloring ;; A coloring indicating what should be done with the entry
           ;; in question one of Red, Green, or Nil (no change).
  Errors   ;; A list of possible error fields to be used with argument
           ;; hints if necessary.
  )


;;; hint-return-val
;;; hint-return-values are retunred as a result of help calls such as
;;; get-proc-help and explain-more.  They will be a command most likely
;;; show-hint.  The Andes spec allows a naked hintspec to be supplied as
;;; a result of these.  The system will spoof these to be a show-hint.
(defstruct (hint-return-val (:include dde-result))
  )


;;; Eqn-results
;;; Equation results are returned from calls to the algebra system.  
;;; they will contain both equation strings and the usual optional
;;; command field.  
(defstruct (eqn-result (:include dde-result))
  Eqn  ;; The equation string.
  )

;;; Command parameters.

;;; dde-result command tests.



;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; When dealing with show-hints the value will be a tuple of the form
;;; (<HintString> <Menu>) This code facilitates getting that for the
;;; user if it is appropriate.  (note no typechecking is done.)
  
(defun show-hint-ddr-menu (Result)
  "The dde result menu is returned."
  (dde-result-menu Result))




;;; -------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; DDE Hint Results
;;; For code's sake these functions extract the hint text from a show-hint-cmd



;;;; ========================================================================
;;;; Command Result Tests.
;;;; The predicates in this section are used to classify commands according
;;;; to their results.

;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; General result-tests
;;; The tests in this section check the state of the incoming commands
;;; irrespective of their type.  These are valid on any command that
;;; recives a status return-val as its result.  This includes all entries
;;; all answer attempts, and many state commands such as open-problem
;;; and read-student-info.

;;; A cmd is incorrect when it it has a result, that result has 
;;; a status return val and that status return val is color red.



;;; ------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Entry status tests.
;;; These functions test whether the incoming command is an entry and
;;; test its state.

;;; General entries.


;;;; ----------------------------------------------------------------------
;;;; Hint Tests.
;;;; These predicates test whether or not the returned value from the 
;;;; command includes a show-hint command and, if so what type of hint
;;;; it is.

;;; Return t if this command has a result, the result is a cmdresult struct.
;;; And the struct contains a show-hint command.
(defun show-hint-cmdp (CMD)
  "Does this command return a dde-result?"
  (let ((Result (cmd-result CMD)))
    (and Result (cmdresult-p Result)
	 (setq Result (cmdresult-value Result)) ;; returns the val.
	 (dde-result-p Result)
	 (equal (dde-result-command Result) +show-hint+))))
