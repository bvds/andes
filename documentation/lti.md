# Connect with LTI #

The goal is to creqte a working example in Sakai & Canvas.

How to get a problem chooser so that someone can assemble a curriculum?

This might be a good starting point:

There is a php library for LTI and the Andes install assumes PHP exists, so this is probably the way to go.
See [LTI-Tool-Provider-Library-PHP](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/LTI-Tool-Provider-Library-PHP)
The server install now includes intallation of this library.
