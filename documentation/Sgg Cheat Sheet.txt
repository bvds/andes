Starting up and loading the System.
Immediately after starting up Allegro:
    :pa user                 ; needed in IDE: set package to user.
    :ld C:/Andes2/sgg/loader ; loads sgg and kb code. Recompiles as needed

Solving a problem:
    (s kt1a)            ; solve named problem

Examining results for current problem after solving:
    (ps)                  ; print report of each solution found    
    (pg)                  ; print bubble graph	
    (pgn N)               ; print graph node N -- shows PSM graph (maybe long)  
    (pgv)                 ; print index of all variables
    (pge)                 ; print index of all equations      
    (pe)                  ; print equation subsets constituting a solution
    (pep N)               ; print contents of equation set numbered N
  
Reload knowledge base after change
    (rkb)                 ; reload knowledge base

Controlling trace output -- Set to T for on, NIL for off:
    (watch op1 op2...)    ;; turn on tracing within named operators
    (unwatch op1 op2...)  ;; remove given ops from the trace list
    (unwatch)             ;; remove all ops from the trace list
    (setf *actions* T)         ;; print verbose trace of all problem solving
    (setf *debug* T)           ;; print debug output inside operators
    (setf *s-print-steps* NIL) ;; suppress printing of substep results

Writing problem files
    (spf)                 ; store .prb problem file for current problem
    (make-prbs)           ; make all problems w/features working & andes2
    (make-prbs 'kinematics 'statics ...)  
			  ; make all working problems w/specified feature tags

Force recompilation of all sgg sources (shouldn't be necessary, but harmless)
    (ra)                  ; recompile-all
