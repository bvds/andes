<h2>Informed Consent</h2>

The status of informed consent is tracked in the <code>STUDENT_STATE</code>
table in the database, with <code>model='client'</code>.&nbsp;  
The properties <code>consent-dialog</code> &amp; <code>informed-consent</code>
are used to track status for each user and section.

<p>The property <code>consent-dialog</code> sets the consent form
for a section or user; consent forms are stored as <code>*.html</code> files
in the <code>review</code> directory.&nbsp;  The value for this 
property normally contains the name of the <code>*.html</code> file.&nbsp;
If no consent form has been specified, then the student is
shown the default form <code>consent.html</code>.&nbsp;
If <code>consent-dialog</code> is set to value <code>none</code> 
then the student is never shown a consent form.

<p>The property <code>informed-consent</code>
specifies the status for a particular student or section.&nbsp;
If the student clicks on a consent form, then the result
is recorded in  <code>informed-consent</code> as
<code>agree:<em>name</em></code> or 
<code>disagree:<em>name</em></code>.&nbsp;
If consent has been given externally to Andes, this can be
specified as <code>external:<em>name</em></code>.

<p>To create a consent form for a new section, create a new
file in the <code>review</code> directory, 
using <code>review/consent.html</code> as a model.&nbsp;
Start up lisp and do the following to use that form
for a given section:
<pre>
(rhelp) ;load help system
(andes-database:create) ;open database connection
;; Use form my-consent.html for section my-section:
(andes-database:set-state-property "consent-dialog" "my-consent.html" 
      :model "client" :section "my-section" :student nil :tid t)
(andes-database:destroy)
</pre>

<p>If students have given consent externally for a
section, this can be specified in the following manner: 
<pre>
(rhelp) ;load help system
(andes-database:create) ;open database connection
(andes-database:set-state-property "consent-dialog" "none" 
      :model "client" :section "my-section" :student nil :tid t)
(andes-database:set-state-property "informed-consent" "external:my-form" 
      :model "client" :section "my-section" :student nil :tid t)
;; If a particular student has opted-out, it can be specified as:
(andes-database:set-state-property "informed-consent" "opt-out:my-form" 
      :model "client" :section "my-section" :student "bad-student" :tid t)
(andes-database:destroy)
</pre>

<h2>Researcher Access</h2>

The Andes database has a user account <code>open</code> which
gives access only to anonymized data where informed consent has been 
given.&nbsp; The user <code>open</code> has access the tables
<code>OPEN_STUDENT_STATE</code> and <code>OPEN_PROBLEM_ATTEMPT</code>
which have anonymized user names and contain only users who have
given informed consent.

<p>Note that user names starting with <code>x:</code> or <code>md5:</code>
are assumed to have already been anonymized.&nbsp;  This allows user names
to be encoded externally to Andes.&nbsp;  Generally, this is a preferred
method of anonymization since user names are then protected between
the client and the Andes server.
