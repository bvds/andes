/* AndesDatabaseCreationSQL.sql
   This is a set of batch SQL commands created by Nicholas Vaidyanathan to simplify 
   the process of installing the Andes 3 logging DB Schema. To use this script, 
   run mysql -u root and enter in the password from the shell environment, then once
   mysql is started issue the command:
	 \. AndesDatabaseCreationSQL.sql
   
  This is a lazy, barebones script that will just create the Andes database and all associated tables. It will then 
  attempt to populate them with data based upon CSV files stored in a local directory, in the present case, mine.
  In the future, this is a good candidate to be converted into a shell script, with command line arguments for the user directory
