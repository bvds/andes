Welcome to Andes!&nbsp;  Our team at Arizona State University, under
the direction of Prof. Kurt Vanlehn, is studying how students learn 
as they use the Andes tutor system.&nbsp;  As you solve problems
in Andes, your activities will be recorded and stored in a database.&nbsp;
Our research study will involve analysis of the student work that 
has been recorded.&nbsp;  We invite you participate in this study.

<p>
<strong>Study Purpose:</strong>&nbsp;  To study how students learn physics when using an intelligent tutoring system.&nbsp; The results of this study will allow us to make improvements to Andes and other tutoring systems, as well as give us insight into how students learn physics.

<p>
<strong>Study Procedure:</strong>&nbsp;  As you solve problems in Andes, we will collect your work, or "log data", and store it in a database.&nbsp;  We will then analyze the log data to learn how students behave and learn when using Andes.&nbsp;  Your participation in the study will not affect in any way the behavior of Andes or the grades you receive.

<p>
<strong>Confidentiality:</strong>&nbsp;  Your log data will be stored in a password-protected database.&nbsp;  Researchers will not be able to see your user name or any other identifying information.&nbsp;  In addition, if you state that you do not want to participate in the study, researchers will not be able to access your log data.&nbsp;   The log data of study participants will be made available to Prof. Vanlehn's research team.  Participant log data 
may be stored indefinitely in the 
<a href="http://learnlab.org">LearnLab</a> 
<a href="https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu">DataShop repository</a>
at Carnegie Mellon University.&nbsp;  Only registered users of the
LearnLab DataShop will have access to the 
data for analysis purposes.
