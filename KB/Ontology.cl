;; required-identities -- identity equations that must always be written out

;; This is used by the constraints in Help/interpret-equation.cl that 
;; check whether fundamental equations are written explicitly. Those constraints
;; allow variable identity equations to be exploited when formulating principles,
;; because they usually are trivial artifacts of choice of a quantity. But
;; a few identities express important principles that we want to see written
;; explicitly, so we enumerate them here.
;;
;; !!! Keeping exception list here is fragile wrt changes in kb. Maybe could 
;; just exclude any identity that is marked as "major"? Though that wouldn't block
;; projection, which is minor.

;; Following function maps a quantity name symbol -- the car of some quantity 
;; expression -- to that of its net form, if one exists.

;; Note error handlers may wind up looking up e.g. (define-var (NIL ...))
;; in this case, so that should never be used as a quantity name.
