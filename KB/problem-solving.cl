;; ============== Top-level search support ===================
  
;; The top-level search for a solution is driven externally by the 
;; "Bubble Graph" generator written in Lisp.  It aims to build a network
;; of quantities and applicable equations containing them that may be 
;; searched to find sets of equations sufficient to solve for the problem 
;; sought(s).  In the course of this process the bubble graph generator 
;; repeatedly invokes the problem solver as a subroutine whenever it needs 
;; to generate an an equation containing a given quantity (top-level sought or
;; intermediate sought). The problem solver then uses the KB operators to 
;; generate an applicable equation containing the requested quantity.
;; 
;; Each invocation of the problem solver applies one problem solving method 
;; (PSM) to generate one result equation for a single sought quantity (although
;; subsidiary equations may be written as well).  No problem solver
;; state persists across invocations, so each invocation is entirely 
;; independent of any other. 
;; 
;; The Bubble-Graph generator invokes the problem-solver code to achieve a
;; top-level goal of applying a PSM to generate an equation for
;; a sought quantity. This goal is represented by a proposition of the 
;; form (PSM ?sought ?eqn-id ?eqn ?remaining-unknowns), with ?sought
;; bound to a quantity term coming in.  Thus this goal represents the
;; main top-level entry point into the problem solver.
;;
;; The operators for applying specific PSMs should result in a statement of
;; the form (PSM-applied ?sought ?eqn-id ?eqn-algebra) in wm.  These
;; operators do the real PSM-specific work of generating an equation.
;; The following operator encapsulates the common bookkeeping needed to
;; finish up the PSM application after some equation has been so generated.
;; It posts the final PSM statement the top-level driver keys on.
;; It does the following:
;;
;; 1. Sometimes a PSM might get applied and generate an equation which does not
;; actually contain the sought quantity. This can happen because the 
;; applicability tests for some PSMs check only that the equation *might* 
;; contain the sought quantity.  A test here fails in these cases. Since the 
;; final PSM statement is never posted, these blind alleys don't make it into 
;; the solution at all.
;;
;; 2. Here is common code to collect the residual unknowns from the equation 
;; for inclusion in the final "PSM" statement as a service to the bubble-graph
;; generator.
;;
;; 3. Some vars in the equation such may become known as a side effect of 
;; applying the PSM. For example, vector direction variables typically become 
;; known as the vectors are drawn by the relevant operators. In this case the
;; operator should add a "given" statement for them to wm since they are
;; now like the givens in not needing to be sought.  ("given" is being
;; used to mean "known").  We write equations for all these new knowns here 
;; since these equations are required for algebraic completeness.
;;
;; Some of these equations correspond to steps the student will have to write; 
;; others, in particular those for angles of drawn vectors, need not be
;; written by the student although they may be.  Issues pertaining to writing
;; equations for givens may have to be worked out later. For now we declare 
;; this operator unordered so that the given equation steps may occur in
;; any order with respect to the other steps.
;;
;; The hints pertaining to the top-level search for a solution must be
;; handled specially, because they should be questions: "What
;; quantity are you seeking?" and "What method should be used to find
;; it?"  These questions comprise the preamble discussed in the
;; proposal.  The specification document works out how the preamble
;; will be generated from the bubble graph.  Thus, there are no hints on 
;; operators that exist to support this top-level search.

;;; ================== applying vector equations ===================
;;; These operators are the second of the two main top level methods for
;;; finding a value for a variable.  They apply vector equations.
;;; The major steps are to draw a vector diagram, write the component
;;; equation, find expressions for each of the components, then write
;;; the final equation which is free of component variables.
;;; 
;;; The component equation is an equation where all the vector
;;; components are expressed in terms of component variables. 
;;; The author of a vector PSM, such as Newton's law or Kinematics, must 
;;; define operators for
;;; 
;;; *  eqn-family-contains -- indicates which quantities might be found 
;;;                           with this
;;; *  vector-diagram -- procedure for drawing the appropriate vectors
;;;                      and choosing the coordinate system
;;; *  compo-eqn-contains -- which quantities various component eqns find
;;; 
;;; This operator takes care of the rest of the job of applying
;;; the vector equation.  
;;; 
;;; Kinematics is treated as one vector PSM even though it has 5
;;; different component equations that can be used with it, all of
;;; which reference the same vector diagram.  This means that no
;;; matter which of the 5 equations the student will eventually write,
;;; the student must first draw all the kinematic vectors.  Hope this
;;; is OK with the instructors.
;;; 
;;; Because the reasoning done by these operators is covered by the
;;; preamble, they have no hints.

;;
;; Following applies vector PSMs writing component equations.
;; Note that compo-eqn-contains will be asserted by a vector PSM for
;; the *magnitude* of the relevant vector, so we have to temporarily
;; pretend we are seeking that when running through the generic equation
;; selection code. This avoids having to add new stuff to the existing
;; equation-contains stuff.

;;; with (during 1 2) as the time.  But time point 1 is not included

;;; open, not closed.  However, it would be odd to change the
;;; semantics of (during 1 2) so that it measn a closed interval when
;;; used on an axis and an open interval when used elsewhere.  Thus,

;;; =================  Inheritance of quantities =============================
;;;
;;;  When a quantity is constant over a larger interval of time,
;;;  it should also be used over shorter time intervals.
;;;  Also, quantities are sometimes timeless.
;;;  Likewise for spatial homogeneity and for currents in a circuit.
;;;
;;;  Such inheritance is achieved via the (inherit-quantity ?child ?parent)
;;;  proposition.  There are two places where this is invoked.
;;;  First, in find-by-PSM and apply-vector-PSM, one looks for equations  
;;;  that contain the ?sought or contain any ?child of the sought.
;;;  Second, when a variable is defined or a vector is drawn, we
;;;  want the parent quantity to be used.
;;;  
;;;  Generally, PSM's involving only one quantity, like vector
;;;  component equations, should not use inheritance, since there 
;;;  should be only one instance of that PSM.  The vector drawing
;;;  or variable definition operator should determine if the quantity
;;;  can be defined on the user interface.

;;;  There is a subtlety with the SGG:  if (inherit-quantity ...) has 
;;;  already been calculated previously in the solution graph, with the
;;;  result in working memory, then this operator will fail.  Thus, we
;;;  have two versions:  one that unifies with working memory, and one
;;;  that calculates (inherit-quantity ...) anew.

;;; ========== Generic knowledge about equal and proportional quantities ======
;;;
;; Equal quantities: this is a generic operator that writes the
;; equality between scalar quantities in cases where it can be determined
;; that two differently-defined quantities are equal. In some problems
;; this may be given or derived by special rules from the problem situation, 
;; e.g.  in a round trip, distance traveled out = distance traveled back.
;; We use the generic "equals" rather than writing out the specific equality
;; first, so this info can be put in the givens; and second, so that it can
;; be used to mark cases where the substitution of equal quantities may be 
;; made by the student in the head. In cases where the equality is based on a 
;; fundamental principle like Newton's third law we label it as such and
;; do not use the (equals ...) proposition.
;; Although most hints for equations are hung off the operator whose
;; effects include (eqn...), in this case, the hints are hung off the operator
;; whose effects include (equals ...).
;;
;; On symmetry:  Andes does not really have a method to express symmetries
;; properly, since that would involve a coordinate transformation (for spatial
;; symmetries) or a transformation over objects for other symmetries.
;; Thus, we use (equals ...) to express symmetries, 
;; with the Keyword :hint to express any special hints and :opposite to express
;; quantities that are odd under a symmetry.
