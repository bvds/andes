;; This file defines nogoods for the Newtons2.cl physics code.
;;
;; Nogood rules restrict allowable combinations of psm equations into 
;; solution sets, operating on assumptions defined in the psms. Assumptions
;; are arbitrary propositions introduced by (assume ....) in the effects
;; of an operator; their only effect is in these nogood rules.
;;
;; Note: associated messages not currently printed by the sgg.


;; Algebraic independence alone will not in general prohibit using equations
;; projecting a single body's vectors along non-orthogonal pairs of axis 
;; directions for a single body or from using multiple axes on the same body's
;; vectors for different parts of the problem. Although this might conceivably 
;; be a useful strategy in some problems, it is not a usual problem-solving 
;; practice for introductory problems and is not expected to be useful 
;; in any Andes problems.  
;
;; Following rules constrain the axis drawing itself, this is more fundamental 
;; than choice of equations to combine in a solution.
;
;; Note that since the Andes axis tool always draws a coordinate *system* of 
;; two orthogonal axes, the following two ways of formulating axes constraints 
;; should be entirely equivalent: if you have multiple inequivalent coordinate
;; systems for the same body, then there must exist a non-orthogonal x-y axis 
;; pair, and vice versa. So only one should really be needed unless we modify 
;; the axis tool to allow setting one axis direction only.
