;;; ========================== mass  ======================

;;; Andes has mass on the variables menu even though mass is also
;;; defined as a side-effect of drawing a body.  This means that
;;; whenever a student just wants a variable for mass and doesn't want
;;; to draw a body, there are two ways to do it.  Thus, the solution
;;; graph builder must construct both solutions.
;;;
;;; mass can have time in rocket problems, but is left timeless in others
;;; Which one gets defined is controlled by presence of
;;; in the problem features.

;;; ============================== forces =====================================

;;; For each basic force type we have an operator called find-TYPE-force
;;; which derives a proposition of the form
;;;      (force ?body ?agent ?type ?time ?direction ?action-or-reaction)
;;; This means that the relevant force exists.  These "force-exists" rules
;;; are broken out because there are cases in which we need to know whether
;;; certain forces exist but don't necessarily want the student to draw them.  
;;; There are also operators for drawing force vectors of the different types.  
;;; The hints for the force types are actually associated with these drawing 
;;; operators, because that is where we will have to give help if the 
;;; student fails to draw a needed force. 
;;; The 'action or 'reaction tag is for heuristic purposes: 'reaction forces
;;; are those the explanation of which should appeal to Newton's third law.
;;; We have a single rule that derives the existence of a "reaction" force 
;;; from any "action" force, so this tag also limits the search to find action
;;; forces and so prevents looping which caused problems with other ways of
;;; writing Newton's third law.
;;; Forces on a compound body are also derived from these basic forces on
;;; the simple bodies without having to draw the basic forces.


;;; This operator models drawing a weight force using the Andes force
;;; tool.  The tool not only draws the vector but also defines
;;; variables for the magnitude and the direction of the force.  The
;;; vector predicate contains the information that the student can see
;;; in the vector drawing tool.  In particular, it contains the
;;; direction of the weight vector, 270 degrees.  This is information
;;; is needed by the axis drawing operators in order to rotated the
;;; axes to match the vectors.  All dimensioned numbers are
;;; represented by (dnum <value> <unit>), so the weight force's
;;; direction is (dnum 270 |deg|).

;;; This operator can draw the reaction to any of these "action" forces on 
;;; the other body when needed.  We also have an NTL PSM to put out the 
;;; equation equating the magnitudes.  Currently we only use NTL for forces 
;;; at known directions, so the direction of the reaction force becomes known 
;;; ("given") here.
;;;
;;; A conceptually purer alternative would be to make all our force-inferring 
;;; rules symmetrical, so an interaction statement would directly entail 
;;; *both* forces in the action-reaction pair.  The asymmetrical method used 
;;; here implicates Newton's third law in one direction only.  This seems to 
;;; correspond more to the reasoning we want to tutor on the forces: If a 
;;; table supports a block, we probably want a different hint or dialog for 
;;; the Normal force the table exerts on the block than for the Normal force 
;;; the block exerts on the table, with NTL only mentioned in the second.
;;;
;;; Another way to achieve this heuristic goal would be to write a pair of 
;;; rules for each force, one for each direction, but the current method is 
;;; more economical in treating Newton's third law with a single rule.
;;;
;;; A question is whether the "action" force ought to be drawn before 
;;; drawing the "reaction" force. If we are analyzing the forces on block1 
;;; with block2 on top of it, we might want to draw the downward normal force 
;;; before drawing the upward one.  So here we consult the "force" statement to
;;; test for existence of the action force but don't require drawing it.
;;;
;;; We prevent this operator from applying to interactions involving compound 
;;; bodies to prevent the following problem: two blocks are stacked on
;;; table. The table exerts a normal force on the lower block and also on
;;; the compound. Therefore two reaction forces will be found on the table:
;;; one from the lower block and one from the table.  If we were interested in
;;; all forces on the table for applying Newton's law, this would give us 
;;; the wrong set of forces on the table -- we don't want to count both 
;;; the force from the compound and the one from its part.  This will have to 
;;; be fixed, but for now we just don't apply NTL to compound bodies.  
;;; That is OK in our problems since we are usually interested in the dynamics 
;;; of the compound body and the external forces on it.

;;; compound body force rules
;;; if there is a forceful interaction between a compound body part and
;;; an object outside the compound (i.e. an external force) then there is
;;; an interaction of the same type between the compound and the object.
;;; The general rule is that the magnitude of a force of type T on the compound
;;; from a is the sum of the magnitudes of the forces of type T from that agent
;;; on the parts.  This sum rule is needed to handle cases where the same agent
;;; may have an interaction of the same type with several of the bodies.  
;;; For ex, if two blocks are pushed side by side along a plane, the net normal
;;; force from the plane on the compound is the sum of the normal forces from 
;;; the plane on each of the blocks; similarly for kinetic friction on the 
;;; compound. However:
;;; -In the case of weight, Wc = m1 * g + m2 * g simplifies to the simple 
;;; weight law applied to the compound Wc = mc * g where mc = m1 + m2
;;; so we can also get it this way (this is one advantage of compounding.)
;;; -Applied or tension force will typically act at a point on only one of 
;;; the parts so there can only be one such force on the compound. 
;;; Thus the sum rule will really only be needed for normal and friction forces
;;; from a surface.  But if there is more than one unknown force of this type
;;; then the problem is not much simplified by treating the objects as a 
;;; compound body anyway.  So we could just ignore this case and only write 
;;; a rule to handle the case where there is a single force of the given type. 
;;; Still it doesn't seem to hurt to write the general rule.
;;;
;;; Note this means there are now two operators to draw the weight force on 
;;; a compound, one using the weight operator and the other using the
;;; force on compound operator . There are also two corresponding 
;;; equations for the magnitude of the weight on the compound. We could
;;; filter in the force-compound rule to exclude weight, but since this is

;;;; ========================== Newton's law ================================ 

;;; NL is newton's second law.  It is represented by several operators.  
;;; 
;;; The first one indicates what quantities might be contained in the
;;; equation if it should be written.  Note that the quantities are
;;; not guaranteed to be contained in the ultimate equation.  For
;;; instance, if the body is not accelerating, then the variables for
;;; mass and acceleration will not be in the equation.  When the
;;; solver unifies with one of the quantities in the list, some
;;; variables in the vector equation's identifier are bound.  For NL,
;;; the body and time are always bound.
;;; 
;;; The other operators expects to get a vector equation identifier
;;; that has some arguments bound, and they do all the work to write
;;; the equation.  So the vector equation identifier is a way of
;;; passing info (e.g., the body and the time) from the sought
;;; quantity to the hard working operator.
;;; 
;;; I'm not sure if hints on this operator will ever be used, but if
;;; so, it would be better to have the sought quantity available, as
;;; that would make the hint message nicer.
